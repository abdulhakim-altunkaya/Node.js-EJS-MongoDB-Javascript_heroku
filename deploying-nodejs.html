<h1>HOW TO PUT NODE.JS FILE INTO YOUR WEBSITE</h1>
<h5>18 May 2021, Abdulhakim Altunkaya</h5>
<p>Hello everybody,<br><br>
People starting to learn coding first ask how to put javascript into their HTML/CSS website. Then as we move, we started to realize a “back-end” of the websites, and ask this question again this time for node.js, php or python. After spending sometime on localhost on your computer, it’ll be time to move on to real servers.

Unless you have advanced server configuration skills (if you had, you wouldnt be reading this), you cannot just grab your node.js file and drop it in your website directory. You'll need service from node.js hosting companies. Some of those companies:
</p>
Microsoft Azure<br>
Google Cloud <br>
Amazon Web Services <br>
Heroku <br>
Evennode<br>
Kamatera<br>
A2Hosting....
<p>So, you can go ahead and create an account with one of them. Personally, I advice Microsoft Azure or Heroku. Of course, start with the free plan.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, Regards <br>
